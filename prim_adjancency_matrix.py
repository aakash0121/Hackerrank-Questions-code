# The time complexity for the matrix representation is O(V^2).
# In this post, O(ELogV) algorithm for adjacency list representation is discussed.
# As discussed in the previous post, in Primâ€™s algorithm, two sets are maintained,
# one set contains list of vertices already included in MST, other set contains vertices not 
# yet included. With adjacency list representation, all vertices of a graph can be traversed in O(V+E) 
# time using BFS. The idea is to traverse all vertices of graph using BFS and use a Min Heap to store the 
# vertices not yet included in MST. Min Heap is used as a priority queue to get the minimum weight edge from 
# the cut. Min Heap is used as time complexity of operations like extracting minimum element and decreasing key 
# value is O(LogV) in Min Heap.
